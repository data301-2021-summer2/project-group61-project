# 1. What variables within this dataset have the highest potential of interdependence?
# From the dataset, Social support, Life Ladder, and Log GDP have the highest potential of interdependence. Looking at the correlation data on line 123 and 115 in the EDA, plotting social support against life ladder gives a strong linear correlation of 0.75/1. This shows that an increase in social support is likely to correspond to, or be followed by a net increase in  the life ladder. When collecting this data, the question posed  in order to gage the level social support was whether the person had donated to any charities in the last month. Possible reasons for this include the fact that social support through charity might result in more people being able to afford better food, medication, shelter, and nutrition, which would have a net positive effect on the the national life ladder scores. This increase in life quality or life ladder scores would lead to an increase in GDP, because of a net increased productivity, and entrepreneurship, as supported by the correlation data to be mentioned. The correlation data between GDP and life ladder in line 115, supported by lines 116 and 123, suggest a strong correlation between the two, with a correlation coefficient of 0.8. The visible increase as seen in the dot plot in line 116 further supports this.  Additionally, the box plots in line 121 and 127 show that the highest average GDP and highest average social support for all countries occur in the same year, in 2020. Furthermore, the lowest average GDP and lowest average social support also occur in the same year, 2018, further supporting the initial claim of the three variables having the highest potential of interdependent. 


# Some limitations to this dataset include the fact that the contributions of a regular donator who donated over a month ago might be neglected, hence underestimating the true value, or that of one who donates once in a while might skew the data, and subsequent result in an overestimate of the true value. However, because the these confounding variables have the opposite effect, and a similar likelihood of occurring within the random sample, the results would ideally be holistically skewed, which might affect the values, but not the trend, allowing the above inference to stand.

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Understanding the indicators of happiness is important because it gives insight into the effects that policy affecting those indicators might impact the lives of the general public. Our attraction to this topic is as a result of its wide potneital implications and applications, if the right questions are asked. I am particularly interested in analyzing the indicators of happiness across different regions, and how geography might play a part in determining them.

The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors.

Why: What is the purpose of your dataset? Is it for transparency/accountability, public interest, fun, learning, etc…
Governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.
